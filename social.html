                    <p>
                        Persona 5 (like the 3rd and 4th entries in the series) has once again implemented social stats into the game. These stats are quite different to other skills that you might raise during the progress of the game and also carry a lot of benefits if raised correctly. Knowledge, Guts, Proficiency, Kindness and Charm are the 5 stats that you will be working on throughout the game. All of these stats each have five ranks to them that you will want to considerately raise if you want to get the most out of the game. The majority of <b>Confidants</b> in Persona 5 will eventually require one of your social stats to be at a certain level. This can be quite an annoying obstacle, especially if you have some stats lower than others. The aim of this guide is to help your raise these stats as quick as possible, so that you can get right back into the story and not miss out on any of your favorite characters!
                        <p>
                            <p>
                                Whilst it's possible to raise all of your stats to MAX in your first playthrough, this is quite a difficult task (especially for new players) and should be done with a guide if this is what you're aiming to achieve. No fear however, for casuals at the game that like to explore and make their own path without worry, New Game+ exists to carry over all your existing stats into a new playthrough!

                        One of the easiest ways to advance your skill in Knowledge is by simply answering questions correctly whenever you're in class. To make this as easy as possible, head over to the <a href="/answers.html">Test Answers</a> page to make sure you're at the top of the class! Most of the knowledge that you'll gain over the course of the game will come from doing this, but you can also visit the school libary at the end of the day and study in the corner (also raises the Guts stats but can possibly lower the amount of Knowledge you recieve.</p>

                    <p>When returning to Cafe Leblanc after a long day, Sojiro will allow you to use the booths to sit and study (providing you scare off the customers with your listening skills). Doing this on a rainy day will gain you additional points. Another way to increase your knowledge is by answering the question from the TV quiz every <i>Wednesday</i> at Leblanc. You can also gain two knowledge points a day by either drinking coffee or Frui-Tea in Shibuya diner.</p>

                    <p>When it comes to exam season, you may be asked by one of your friends to join in on a study session. Taking part in these sessions will allow for both you Knowledge and relationship level to increase! Another method that is avaliable to you near the start of the game is reading books. Make sure to regularly visit the book store in Shibuya and buy-out their stock if you want to maximise your stat gain. You can read these books both on the train and at school. A table of all the books that increase knowledge and where you can find them can be found below!
