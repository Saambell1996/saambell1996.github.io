                            Persona 5 (like the 3rd and 4th entries in the series) has once again implemented social stats into the game. These stats are quite different to other skills that you might raise during the progress of the game and also carry a lot of benefits if raised correctly. Knowledge, Guts, Proficiency, Kindness and Charm are the 5 stats that you will be working on throughout the game. All of these stats each have five ranks to them that you will want to considerately raise if you want to get the most out of the game. The majority of <b>Confidants</b> in Persona 5 will eventually require one of your social stats to be at a certain level. This can be quite an annoying obstacle, especially if you have some stats lower than others. The aim of this guide is to help your raise these stats as quick as possible, so that you can get right back into the story and not miss out on any of your favorite characters!
                            <p>
                                <p>
                                    Whilst it's possible to raise all of your stats to MAX in your first playthrough, this is quite a difficult task (especially for new players) and should be done with a guide if this is what you're aiming to achieve. No fear however, for casuals at the game that like to explore and make their own path without worry, New Game+ exists to carry over all your existing stats into a new playthrough!

                            One of the easiest ways to advance your skill in Knowledge is by simply answering questions correctly whenever you're in class. To make this as easy as possible, head over to the <a href="/answers.html">Test Answers</a> page to make sure you're at the top of the class! Most of the knowledge that you'll gain over the course of the game will come from doing this, but you can also visit the school libary at the end of the day and study in the corner (also raises the Guts stats but can possibly lower the amount of Knowledge you recieve.</p>

                        <p>When returning to Cafe Leblanc after a long day, Sojiro will allow you to use the booths to sit and study (providing you scare off the customers with your listening skills). Doing this on a rainy day will gain you additional points. Another way to increase your knowledge is by answering the question from the TV quiz every <i>Wednesday</i> at Leblanc. The crossword that is avaliable at Leblanc will also score you two points. You can also gain two Knowledge points a day by either drinking coffee or Frui-Tea in Shibuya diner. You can easily gain three points in Knowledge by Watching the movie “Back To The Ninja” which is available during Oct-Nov
                        </p>

                        <p>When it comes to exam season, you may be asked by one of your friends to join in on a study session. Taking part in these sessions will allow for both you Knowledge and relationship level to increase! Another method that is avaliable to you near the start of the game is reading books. Make sure to regularly visit the book store in Shibuya and buy-out their stock if you want to maximise your stat gain. You can read these books both on the train and at school. A table of all the books that increase knowledge and where you can find them can be found below!

                        <p>
                            An easy way to raise your Guts is by taking part in <a src="#">Tae Takemi's</a> clinical tortu....I mean trials. This confidant becomes avaliable fairly early in the game just before you take on <a src="#">Kamoshida's Castle</a>. By allowing her to use you as her guinea pig, it becomes easy to gain a few points in Guts here and there! Doing this will also raise your level with the Death confidant which will help speed you towards better medicine and important accessories (Rank 5 SP Regen item).
                        </p>

                        <p>If you go to Shibuya and go just past the bookstore, you will find yourself a handy little diner where you can both order coffee (this game loves coffee..) and raise your Guts! (as well as Knowledge on occasion). Also in Shibuya is a Big Bang Burger where you can take on the restraunts challenge and score yourself a few handy points in Guts. The challenge is actually a stat test for your character and you will only be able to fully complete the challenge if you have a certain number of stats. </p>

                        <p>
                            Completing the challenge succesfully you will be rewarded with a prize as well as a boost to your Guts level as well as your other stats. But even if you fail the test you will still get a boost to your Guts so it's still worth it either way! When you unlock the Red-light district, you will be able to start working at the Crossroads bar to periodically raise your guts. Some of the additional ways to raise Guts come from the likes of visting the Cinema, watching DVD's and reading books. These items will be included in a table below for your convience.

                    <div class="proficiency-section">
                        <p>Proficiency is a short and sweet stat to get up and honestly one that's pretty useful when it comes to the dungeon crawling sections of the game. The easiest way to gain a steady amount of proficiency points would be by simply crafting infiltration tools. The majority of these tools are really useful inside Palaces and lockpicks especially are essential items if you're looking to claim all the late game loot!</p>

                        <p>It's worth nothing that as you gain levels in Proficiency, you will also increase the amount of tools you can craft in a single day! This is one of the easier stats to raise but honestly takes quite a bit of time out of your day to day, so plan accordingly! Some of the other examples of raising your Proficiency are working in the beef bown shop in Shibuya, training in the batting cages, (have to actually hit the ball to have a chance of raising points) as well as starting and finishing the burger challenge at Big Bang Burger! </p>

                        <p>As always, they're a few books you can read to raise your social stats, and Proficiency makes the cut here too! Find below a table of all the books that will aid you on your journey!</p>

                        <p>The Kindness stat allows you to further progress in certain confidants storylines as well as interact with different things in the world. Like most of the stats their exists an early method of raising the stat, and this time it involves...looking after your plant? So yeah, get fresh with nature, give your room a tidy and gain access to your plant as soon as possible! Once you have done this you're able to buy Nutrients from the flower shop located in the underground mall. This will give you the chance to examine your plant before you go to bed and feed it; giving you a nice and easy source of raising your kindness. The downside to this is that it can only be done every couple of weeks, but remember to check on your plant every day and have a good amount of nutrients on you!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Other than getting friendly with nature, you can also get friendly with your guardian, Sojiro! By working through his confidant story and slowly unravelling that he's really just a big softy, you are able to gradually increase your kindness! The last two methods involve working part time at either the flower shop (Where you will recieve point based on how well you deal with the customers) and the Crossroads bar, which gets unlocked a little way through the start of the game.

                        <p>So, you want to raise your Charm to impress your favorite characters? Well lucky for your there's a bathhouse right outside where you live! That's right, for a small fee and a portion of your time, you are able to gain very easy charm points just by taking care of your personal hygine; whoda thunk it! Try going there on Mondays or Thursdays or on any day it's raining for some juicy extra points!</p>

                        <p>Whilst the bathhouse is definitely the easiest way to increase your Charm points, other ways will pop up every now again such as when you're spending time with confidants, doing well on exams, working at the crossroads bar and eating out at some of your favorite restraunts! I highly recommend just abusing the bathhouse to raise your Charm but try not to focus only on raising charm as the other social stats are just as important!</p>

                        <p>Once again we have another table full of useful books, and thankfully this is the last one as our social stats journey comes to an end!</p>
