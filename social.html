                        Persona 5 (like the 3rd and 4th entries in the series) has once again implemented social stats into the game. These stats are quite different to other skills that you might raise during the progress of the game and also carry a lot of benefits if raised correctly. Knowledge, Guts, Proficiency, Kindness and Charm are the 5 stats that you will be working on throughout the game. All of these stats each have five ranks to them that you will want to considerately raise if you want to get the most out of the game. The majority of <b>Confidants</b> in Persona 5 will eventually require one of your social stats to be at a certain level. This can be quite an annoying obstacle, especially if you have some stats lower than others. The aim of this guide is to help your raise these stats as quick as possible, so that you can get right back into the story and not miss out on any of your favorite characters!
                        <p>
                            <p>
                                Whilst it's possible to raise all of your stats to MAX in your first playthrough, this is quite a difficult task (especially for new players) and should be done with a guide if this is what you're aiming to achieve. No fear however, for casuals at the game that like to explore and make their own path without worry, New Game+ exists to carry over all your existing stats into a new playthrough!

                        One of the easiest ways to advance your skill in Knowledge is by simply answering questions correctly whenever you're in class. To make this as easy as possible, head over to the <a href="/answers.html">Test Answers</a> page to make sure you're at the top of the class! </p>
                        <p>Another way to increase your knowledge is by answering the question from the TV quiz every Wednesday at Leblanc. You can also gain two knowledge points a day by either drinking coffee or Frui-Tea in Shibuya diner. Doing this on a rainy day
